This repository includes the code and report for the course project on Deep Learning in the MSc in AI program offered by NCSR Demokritos and the University of Piraeus.

Our objective was to develop a model capable of detecting artificial regions, which are regions generated by AI. Image inpainting is a computer vision technique, where an algorithm attempts to reconstruct or fill in a masked region using information from the surrounding area. To accomplish this, we created a dataset by randomly applying masks to images([orignal](MSc-in-AI-Demokritos-Deeplearning/Data Samples
/original/) & [original_masked](MSc-in-AI-Demokritos-Deeplearning/Data Samples
/original_masked/)). Subsequently, we utilized a GAN network trained specifically for this task to fill these regions. We use the DeepFillv2_Pytorch, basically a Pytorch re-implementation for the paper [Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03589), from this [repo](https://github.com/csqiangwen/DeepFillv2_Pytorch#readme). <br>

Now that we have a dataset comprising of images that contain an artificial region, we need to train our own model that detects such regions (one per image).
