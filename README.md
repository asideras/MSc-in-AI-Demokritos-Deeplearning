This repository includes the code and report for the course project on Deep Learning in the MSc in AI program offered by NCSR Demokritos and the University of Piraeus.

Our objective was to develop a model capable of detecting artificial regions, which are regions generated by AI. The task at hand is image inpainting, a computer vision technique where an algorithm attempts to reconstruct or fill in a masked region using information from the surrounding area. To accomplish this, we created a dataset by randomly applying masks to images. Subsequently, we utilized a GAN network trained specifically for this task to fill these regions. We use the DeepFillv2_Pytorch, basically a Pytorch re-implementation for the paper [Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03589), from this [repo](https://github.com/csqiangwen/DeepFillv2_Pytorch#readme).
